Hypothesis Testing

```{r}
# are entries significantly different in first year summer biomass
model <- lmer(First_Summer_ALF_Biomass_sqrt ~ Entry + (1|LOC:Rep), data=data)
summary(model)
anova(model)
# no, but Larry was different from everything else with increasing biomass
```

```{r}
# are entries significantly different in first year vigor
model2 <- lmer(First_Yr_Regrowth_Vigor ~ Entry + (1|LOC:Rep), data=data)
summary(model2)
anova(model2)
# yes, IAFAL-C3 and Larry 15 had lower vigor and IWAF-L-KS1 had higher vigor
```
